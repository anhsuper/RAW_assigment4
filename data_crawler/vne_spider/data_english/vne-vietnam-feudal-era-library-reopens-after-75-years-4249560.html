There are also more than 4,000 pictures of ancient Hue and modern Hue, the imperial city during the Nguyen Dynasty that reigned from 1802 to 1945.Photos collected from various sources vividly illustrate the unique architecture and lifestyle of the Nguyen Imperial Palace.Vo Le Nhat, Director of Hue Monuments Conservation Center, said the chamber has served many different functions, causing serious damage to its structure.The project to restore the Tang Tho Chamber took seven years to complete.The chamber was considered the national library under the Nguyen Dynasty. It was built on a small island in the Hue Citadel. The two-story building was built with bricks and stones, and roofed with terracotta tiles. The upper floor stored books and documents.It was first built in 1825 during the reign of Emperor Minh Mang, second emperor of the Nguyen Dynasty, with the aim of preserving important papers and documents of the court.The chamber no longer functioned as an archive after 1945. Most of the documents were scattered, lost, or destroyed during the wars that followed.
