As of 4 a.m. Saturday, the center of Nakri, the sixth storm to hit Vietnamese waters this year, was around 160 kilometers (180 miles) northeast of the Southwest Cay islet in Vietnam's Spratly Islands, with a maximum wind speed of 115 kilometers per hour, according to the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
Over the next 24 hours, the storm, projected to become the strongest East Sea storm of the year with wind speeds reaching 11 on the Beaufort scale, will move in a southwesterly direction at 10 kilometers a hour, gaining strength by Sunday morning.
By 4 a.m. Sunday, Nakri wind speeds could reach level 12 on the Beaufort scale at 135 km per hour.
Weather experts have forecast the storm to make landfall in the areas from Binh Dinh to Ninh Thuan provinces. Rainfall in the area, home to popular resort towns Nha Trang and Quy Nhon, has been forecast at 100-400 mm on Saturday night and Sunday, triggering erosion and flash floods. Rainfall of 180 mm in 24 hours is considered heavy.
It will then weaken into a tropical storm over the Central Highlands early on Monday morning, with winds of 60 kph.
The Hong Kong Observatory and the Japan Meteorological Agency have forecast the storm to make landfall in south central Vietnam on Sunday evening or night.
The U.S. Naval Research Laboratory has forecast Nakri would make landfall early on Monday morning.
"The operation of the storm is complicated. It is very rare that Vietnam faces a storm that moves from West to East and then returns to the direction of central provinces from Quang Ngai to Ninh Thuan," said Mai Van Khiem, director of the National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting.
Khiem said there were four tropical storms operating at the same time at sea, making the direction and intensity of Nakri change continuously.
In order to cope with the approaching storm, Binh Dinh, which suffered from heaviest damage from Storm Matmo late last month, will ban all ships and fishing boats from sailing and close all beaches from Saturday afternoon.
In addition, provincial authorities have ordered 1,000 families in coastal areas to evacuate to safer areas.
"Armed forces, including soldiers, members of the police force and civilian volunteers stand ready to respond to rescue operations immediately. This is a strong storm; therefore, all preparation plans should be conducted urgently and proactively"said Ho Quoc Dung, chairman of Binh Dinh Province, home to beloved beach town Quy Nhon.

At sea, 150 ships including that of the navy and the coast guards will be on duty.
