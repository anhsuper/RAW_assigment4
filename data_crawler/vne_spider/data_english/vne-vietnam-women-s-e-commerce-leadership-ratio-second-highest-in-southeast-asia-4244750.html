The survey has been conducted in Hong Kong and six Southeast Asia countries by market research company iPrice Group.This figure was lower than that of Hong Kong (55 percent) but higher than that of Thailand (44 percent), the Philippines (39 percent) and three other Southeast Asian countries, showed the survey.Vietnam’s figure has improved from 37 percent in 2018.In Southeast Asia, however, there is still a gender gap in top positions. Only 31 percent of women have C-level roles - executive levels such as CEO or chief financial officer (CFO).In the vice president position, just 38 percent are women.Overall, there is a 40-60 disparity between women and men when it comes to being in positions of power."Given centuries of gender inequality and women taking time off for child rearing, the disparity isn’t as wide as we may have assumed," the iPrice report said.
