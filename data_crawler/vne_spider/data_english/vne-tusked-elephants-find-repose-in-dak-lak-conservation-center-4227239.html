Thoong Kham, a 26-year-old male elephant, stands amid a forest patch in the Elephant Conservation Center (ECC), Buon Don District of Central Highlands' Dak Lak Province. He is one among 38 tamed elephants in the locality.Around two decades ago, a pack of wild elephants trampled crops and houses in Tanh Linh District of central Binh Thuan Province, killing 12 locals. Authorities later captured six elephants to be kept at Yok Don National Park. But two young elephants at the time, after being released into the wild, returned to wreak havoc, forcing their recapture and taming. The two were subsequently named Thoong Kham (Golden Boy) and Thoong Ngan (Silver Boy).Every year, Kham Sen is taken home to work for a week, either by carrying tourists or helping with farmwork. The rest of his time is spent in the woods.For the last three years, elephants have been incorporated in a first-time tourism model in Vietnam where they would not be used for riding or heavy labor, but allowed to live freely in the wild under the care of a trainer. Tourists are only allowed to view the elephants from afar.Part of Kham Sen's tusks were sawed off so he would not endanger his carers and tourists.Dak Lak has the largest number of elephants, including wild and tamed, in Vietnam. According to ECC, about 80-100 wild elephants and 38 domesticated ones are left as of 2019. Vietnam's breeding efforts among domesticated elephants over the past three decades have proven unsuccessful due to limited space for mating and poor health of the animals.
