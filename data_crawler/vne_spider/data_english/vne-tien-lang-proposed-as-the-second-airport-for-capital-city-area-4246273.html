The proposal is part of the national 2021-2030 airport development plan with vision until 2050 that was submitted to the Transport Ministry Tuesday.It also suggested that Cat Bi International Airport's capacity be increased to 13 million passengers in 2030 and 27.6 million in 2045, and small airports be built on the Cat Ba and Bach Long Vi islands for tourism.The proposal for locating the Tien Lang airport in Hanoi is based on a 2016 prime ministerial decision that the capital city area includes Hanoi and nine neighboring provinces of Vinh Phuc, Bac Ninh, Hai Duong, Hung Yen, Ha Nam, Hoa Binh, Phu Tho, Thai Nguyen and Bac Giang, covering an area of over 24,000 square kilometers.Geographically, the Tien Lang Airport will be located in Tien Lang District, Hai Phong City, 120 kilometers to the east of Hanoi and will be connected with Hanoi by the Hanoi-Haiphong Expressway.According to the draft national 2021-2030 airport development plan with a vision to 2050, the second airport of the capital city area will have an annual capacity of 50 million passengers and will be developed after 2040.Some experts have also proposed the location for the second airport of the capital city area in Hanoiâ€™s Ung Hoa District and two provinces neighboring Hanoi, including Hai Duong and Ha Nam.Several other localities have also been demanding airports, saying they will help deliver a "breakthrough in socio-economic development."
