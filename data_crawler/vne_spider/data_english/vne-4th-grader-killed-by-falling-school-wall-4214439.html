The boy tragically died on the spot at the Le Huu Trac Elementary School in Dak Rlap District after he hung on the two-meter school gate to play and other students pushed it back and forth, causing its brick pillar to collapse.Teachers rushed the boy to hospital but doctors could not revive him.A similar accident occurred at a primary school in the northern Lao Cai Province in September this year when similarly the gate collapsed and killed three students and injured three others.A fifth grade student at the Nam Loc Elementary School in the central Nghe An Province was crushed to death when a brick wall fell on him near the school the same month.
