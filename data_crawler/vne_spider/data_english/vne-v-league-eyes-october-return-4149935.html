VPF proposed two plans in order for local clubs to wrap up this V. League season and for players to prepare for tournament crunches later on.The league will restart on October 3.The league's bottom six teams playing to avoid relegation will have all matches wrap up the season by November 15 while the top eight teams competing for the title need to finish by November 22.For the second option, the last matches for the bottom division will proceed until November 22 while the top division concludes on November 29. However, this is the least viable option because clubs have only 45 days to prepare for the 2021 season.VPF said it would require at least 60 days to finish all matches for this season. To prepare for the 2021 season, clubs also need about 45 - 60 days to prepare personnel, finances, and facilities.V-League 2021 is expected to also commence according to the rules of the 2020 season so Vietnamese national team would compete in World Cup 2022 Asian qualifiers and AFF Cup, which had been moved to March and April of next year.Vietnamese football was suspended in late July due to the new Covid-19 outbreak.
