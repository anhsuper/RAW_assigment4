They are part of a non-refundable aid program for quick-impact projects under the framework of the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC), which aims to provide direct socio-economic benefits to communities through short-term projects.MoUs for the projects were signed in Can Tho on Wednesday, the Indian consulate general in HCMC said.Of the seven projects, each costing $50,000, Hau Giang, Kien Giang and Tien Giang will get two each and Ben Tre the other.They will include sewer construction, rainwater collection and storage, and building systems to supply water to areas affected by saltwater intrusion.The seven projects are part of 26 funded by India in 22 localities, half of which have already been completed.The delta has been facing severe saltwater intrusion and the resultant lack of freshwater for irrigation and drinking for years now.A report by the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment at a meeting Wednesday said flood peaks in the upstream stretch of the Mekong River have been lower and later than usual, worsening saltwater intrusion in southern Vietnamese estuaries.Earlier this year six delta provinces, Ben Tre, Ca Mau, Kien Giang, Long An, Soc Trang and Tien Giang, declared an emergency after drought and saltwater damaged around 43,000 ha of paddy and caused 80,000 families to suffer from a water shortage.The government has given eight provinces VND530 billion ($22.77 million) to deal with drought and salinity.
