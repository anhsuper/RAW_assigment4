Nguyen Thanh Binh, chairman of the Mekong Delta province's People's Committee, on Wednesday said the decision stemmed from mobile karaoke services posing a high risk of coronavirus infection, local media reported.Singing karaoke means many people would use the same mic, which may be an infection source if not properly disinfected, he explained. Those who organize or engage with such services would be dealt with in accordance with existing Covid-19 prevention protocols, he added.Previously on Monday, Binh said the province-wide mobile karaoke ban was also based on the recent coronavirus outbreak in Cambodia, which borders An Giang.Due to the complex situation in Cambodia, there is a high chance more Vietnamese would return home, said Binh. As such, border guards need to be more vigilant to keep out illegal entrants, he stressed.Mobile karaoke often takes place at street restaurants or cafes, operated by a pair, of whom one member would be singing songs and the other trying to sell snacks among diners or drinkers, who sometimes partake in the performance.But such services have garnered criticism as they could result in noise pollution. Fights have been sparked by such disputes, resulting in injuries or even death.Last October, a man in southern Dong Nai Province was stabbed to death by his neighbor for singing karaoke loudly until near midnight, reacting aggressively when asked to stop. Similar incidents have been reported often.Vietnam has recorded 2,475 Covid-19 cases so far, with 538 still active.
