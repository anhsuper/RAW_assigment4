Road 769, which runs from the Dau Giay intersection to Highway 51, passes through Thong Nhat and Long Thanh, two main districts in the southern province.The provincial transport department has submitted the road expansion proposal to the Dong Nai People's Committee for approval.The project is a strategic traffic project that will be implemented over the next five years to connect the main highways passing Dong Nai, like the National Highway 1A, 20 and 51. These highways are linked to the mega Long Thanh International Airport, construction of which is set to begin in a couple of days.According to the proposal, the 31-km-long Road 769 will be upgraded in two sections. The first one, running 16km from National Highway 1A to Ring Road 4, will be expanded into four car lanes and two mixed vehicle lanes. The second section from Ring Road 4 to Highway 51, over 15km, will be upgraded and expanded to six car lanes and two mixed vehicle lanes.The Dong Nai Department of Transport has proposed that it will prepare and submit a feasibility report for the project in 2021. The project will be implemented from 2022-2025 with state budget funds.Land on either side of the expanded road sections will also be developed into industrial parks and apartment complexes to raise funds for the project. Two industrial parks and two residential areas covering 364 hectares to host more than 30,000 apartments are already under construction.The government had approved construction of the $4.6 billion first phase of the Long Thanh International Airport last November. If things go smoothly, the first phase is scheduled for completion in 2025.The first phase will include a 4-kilometer long runway with a width of 75 meters and a system of taxiways and apron, and a 373,000-square-meter passenger terminal designed to serve 25 million passengers and 1.2 million tons of cargo per year.This will be the first of three phases of the airport that is expected to be completed by 2040. By then, it will have four runways, four passenger terminals and auxiliaries to accommodate 100 million passengers and 5 million tons of cargo every year.Lying 40 kilometers east of HCMC, the airport is expected to take up the overflow from the Tan Son Nhat International Airport, which is the largest existing airport in the country.
