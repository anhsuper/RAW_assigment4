Indonesia will apply anti-dumping duties of 3.01-49.2 percent on imports from Vietnam. But some major exporters are set to get away with low duties, according to the Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam.Hoa Sen Group will pay 5.34 percent and Ton Dong A Corporation will pay 3.01 percent.The Trade Remedies Authority of Vietnam said it has been informed by the committee that Vietnamese and Chinese cold steel sheets are being imported into Indonesia at a price lower than in those countries, hurting domestic companies.In August 2019, the Indonesian committee announced it was opening the anti-dumping investigation. In July last year, it made a preliminary conclusion that the item under investigation was indeed being dumped.Immediately TRAV sent a letter objecting to some unreasonable aspects of the preliminary conclusion. KADI decided to extend the investigation for six months.Its final conclusion was announced on February 17.
