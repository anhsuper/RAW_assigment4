Tran Anh Tu, chairman of Vietnam Professional Football JSC (VPF), decided to suspend all matches in the fourth round of V. League 1 and await a new announcement from authorities.Organizers have decided to put three matches - Than Quang Ninh FC vs HCMC FC, SHB Da Nang FC vs Ha Tinh FC, and Hai Phong FC vs Hanoi FC - this weekend on hold since the venues and some players stem from localities with fresh outbreak.After 55 days of no community infections, Vietnam registered 84 local cases on Thursday and nine more on Friday morning, to raise the tally to 1,651.Hai Duong is now the biggest hotspot with 77 cases, followed by Quang Ninh with 13 cases, with one each in Hanoi, Bac Ninh and Hai Phong.VPF has yet to decide when the league would resume, saying it will await further developments. It will allow the remaining third round games this weekend to take place normally but with no spectators.The initial Covid-19 outbreak caused the V-League to be postponed after the second round last year, forcing VPF and VFF to change the league format by dividing it into two phases and reducing the number of matches from 26 to 20.After nearly two months, the tournament returned on June 5 before it was postponed again on July 29 due to new Covid-19 resurgences in central Da Nang City. By the end of September, the tournament kicked off the remaining rounds and saw Viettel take home the championship title.
