The decision came after Muangthong filed a lawsuit against Lam with FIFA. The Thai club accused the 27-year-old keeper of terminating his contract without agreement and refusing to train with the club. Lam’s agent Andrey Grushin said the goalie had the right to leave the club since his salary was cut without any prior notice.FIFA said it would send a team to investigate the case. Granting Lam a temporary transfer license does not affect the investigation process, it added.With FIFA's decision, Lam will be allowed to sign a contract with a new club. The keeper’s destination will most likely be Japanese club Cerezo Osaka. According to sports site Goal Thailand, Osaka had asked Japan Football Association (JFA) to request FIFA to grant him the necessary transfer papers.Not only did Muangthong sue Lam and his agent, but also pulled Osaka into the case. Muangthong's technical director Ronarit Suwacha is confident the club will win.Suwacha said JFA has requested FIFA to grant the transfer license for Lam without informing them.He said they will overturn FIFA’s decision, that the club believe the FIFA investigation crew will make a fair decision.In 2019, Muangthong bought Lam from Hai Phong FC for $500,000 after which he became the club's main goalkeeper. But in recent months, he had lost the spot to Thai keeper Samporn Yos and was constantly sidelined. Muangthong also handed him a 30 percent pay cut without telling him in advance.
