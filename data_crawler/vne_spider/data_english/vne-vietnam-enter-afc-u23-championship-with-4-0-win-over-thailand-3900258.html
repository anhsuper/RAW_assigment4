As Thailand lost their key forward Supachai Jaided to a red card for committing fouls, Vietnam beefed up their attacks and scored two more goals, one from a freekick and another also with Hai's assist.
With three wins, Vietnam have officially qualified for the AFC U23 Championship to be held in Thailand next year. Thailand already have a ticket as a host.
At the previous edition of the tournament, Vietnam presented a stunning performance and overcame more fancied teams to enter the final, where it lost 1-2 to Uzbekistan at the last minute of extra time.
