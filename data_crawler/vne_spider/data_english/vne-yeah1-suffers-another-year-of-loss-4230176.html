Amid the Covid-19 pandemic the company, one of the largest digital media ecosystems in Vietnam, decided to set up a new multi-channel trading platform, Giga1, which seeks to cut out intermediaries and deliver goods directly from manufacturers to customers."In 2020, we spent a lot of resources on this ecosystem of consumption and retail, which led to higher spending and affected the companyâ€™s profits," Nguyen Dang Quynh Anh, deputy director of Yeah1, said.Revenues fell by 16 percent last year to VND1.22 trillion. In March, its contract with YouTube was terminated due to a violation of policies.It began as an operational error but later "turned into a real crisis for the company," chairman Nguyen Anh Nhuong Tong said.
