Nicholas Coppel, former Australian ambassador to Myanmar, said the people of Myanmar as well as the military seem to be very firm in their respective positions and there is no conversation between the two. The situation might get worse the longer it remains unresolved. The situation has been continuing for six weeks now; and there's no resolution in sight."In terms of the future, we can see that the situation in Myanmar is very much like a standoff, and that will continue for quite some time until there is a possible change in personalities in the military brass or something like that," Coppel told VnExpress International.Myanmar is experiencing political instability after its army seized power and detained government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and much of her party leadership last month. More than 70 people have been killed in widespread protests against the military’s seizure of power.Mahn Win Khaing Than, an acting vice-president appointed by representatives of Myanmar’s ousted lawmakers, the Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw, addressed the public via Facebook, saying, "This is the darkest moment of the nation and the moment that the dawn is close." He is in hiding along with most senior officials from the ruling National League for Democracy Party, Reuters reported.Coppel said it was difficult to predict what will happen next as the situation remains in flux. He welcomed the statement issued by the President of the United Nations Security Council on Myanmar, saying it showed that the council was deeply concerned about the developments in the country."The democratic processes (mentioned in the statement) include elections, even though they didn't use that word," he said.
