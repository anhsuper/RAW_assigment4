But while it was about 1.5 nautical miles away from the Phu Quy Port, the ship tilted hard and sank. Emergency signals for rescue were continually broadcast from that point.The Binh Thuan border defense force and the Phu Quy search and rescue station dispatched ships to the scene to rescue the crew members. But no one was found as of 6:30 p.m.Despite rough seas and strong winds near the island, the search is ongoing. The search radius has been expanded to three to five nautical miles from the scene of the accident, and additional ships have been deployed.
