The province, home to the famous Ha Long Bay, wants to develop the night-time economy to maximize its potentials, distinctive advantages and special products bringing together nature, people and culture.A representative of the Quang Ninh People’s Committee said Sunday that the development will focus on main areas: culture and entertainment, catering services, shopping services and tourism services.A long-term plan that is being finalized for developing the night-economy will have three phases. During the trial phase for the first two years (2021-2022), the northern province will study and select organizations that can provide night-time services without hurting local security and causing environmental degradation.In the second phase (2022-2025), the focus will be on completing the plans and setting its directions.The last one, from 2025 onwards, will witness the implementation of several night-time projects and entertainment venues in the province.Developing a night-time economy will help Quang Ninh maximize its infrastructure and create new motivation for the economy that delivers financial benefits to its residents, provincial authorities believe."We are completing the scheme to develop the night-time economy with detailed routes and plans. We hope the province's potentials and strengths, especially in tourism, entertainment and cuisine, will be the foundation for our night-time economy to form and develop," a provincial People’s Committee representative said Sunday.Quang Ninh also hopes night-time economic activities will motivate tourists to stay longer and spend more, contributing to socio-economic development and promoting more efficient use of resources.Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Quang Ninh saw a 36.8 percent year-on-year drop in numbers as it welcomed around 8.8 tourists. International tourists paid 536,000 visits, a 90.6 percent drop from 2019, while domestic tourists’ visits increased 0.6 percent to 8.3 million. The province is projected to earn VND17,000 billion ($734.8 billion) from tourism this year, a year-on-year decrease of 42.34 percent.The bandwagonQuang Ninh’s plan is already being considered and/or implemented in other localities.In July 2020, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc approved a master plan for night-time economy development in Vietnam, allowing major cities like Hanoi, HCMC and Da Nang as well as other tourist destinations like Hoi An, Hue, Da Lat and Phu Quoc to pilot night-time services from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.In September, authorities in Hanoi sought feedback for a pilot scheme to allow recreational establishments in Hoan Kiem area to stay open past midnight. Under the scheme, catering, entertainment and shopping services in Hoan Kiem District, the busiest area in the capital city, will be allowed to operate overnight every day while outdoor activities, historical relics and heritage sites will stay open until midnight.Early this month, December, the planning and investment department of Khanh Hoa Province said it was coordinating with other agencies on a plan to develop its night-time economy centered around the famous beach town of Nha Trang.
