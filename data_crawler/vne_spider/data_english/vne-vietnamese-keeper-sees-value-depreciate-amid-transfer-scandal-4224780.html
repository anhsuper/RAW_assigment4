The site also changed his status to "without club."Muangthong United has submitted the case to FIFA, saying Lam terminated his contract ahead of schedule.His contract was to have run until November 2021, but due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Thai League schedule was changed, forcing foreign players to extend their contracts until May 2022. Due to financial crisis, however, the club handed him a 30 percent pay cut without advance notification, according to his agent, Andrey Grushin.The club said that they do not owe the Vietnamese goalkeeper his salary and accused Lam of being unprofessional by not showing up for training.Lam and his agent have said they are ready to fight the Thai club in court.The losing side will face heavy consequences from FIFA. If the Vietnamese goalkeeper lost the lawsuit, he would not only get a fine, but also face four- to six-month suspension for breach of contract. Otherwise, Muangthong United might get relegated.According to previous reports, Lam had reached preliminary agreement with Japanese J1 League club Cerezo Osaka.Russian top-flight club FC Dynamo Moscow and Portuguese side Sporting Braga have since also made offers, with Lam unable to fly to Japan to sign the deal due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.In June 2019, Muangthong United bought Lam from Hai Phong FC for $500,000.
