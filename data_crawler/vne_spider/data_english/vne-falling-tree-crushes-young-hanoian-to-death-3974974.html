A thunderstorm at 5 p.m., right around after office hours, uprooted many trees in half an hour.
Nguyen Huu Huan, 26, died when a tree fell on him near the West Lake, the firefighting department of Tay Ho District said.
Another unidentified person was taken to hospital after a tree fell on him/her on Hoang Hoa Tham Street, also in Tay Ho.
Trees were felled on many downtown Hanoi streets, including Pham Ngoc Thach, Hao Nam, Hoang Quoc Viet and Giang Vo. Traffic in these areas was paralyzed as a result.
"The wind was very strong. I heard people scream and as I just ran outside, a tree fell onto my shop," said Quynh Mai, an employee of a clothing store on Pham Ngoc Thach Street, Dong Da District.
Hers is one of two clothing stores in the area on which a tree fell.
