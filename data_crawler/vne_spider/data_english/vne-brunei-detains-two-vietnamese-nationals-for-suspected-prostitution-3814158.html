Last month, nine Vietnamese were among a group of 24 women arrested in an anti-prostitution raid in Malaysia’s Melaka state.
In February, ten Vietnamese migrant workers were arrested in Taiwan’s Greater Taipei area on suspicion of engaging in sex work.
Vietnam reported 670 human trafficking victims last year, down almost half from 1,128 in 2016.
Most victims were uneducated women and children from poor areas who were sold to men seeking wives in other Asian countries, or just to bear children, or work as prostitutes there.
