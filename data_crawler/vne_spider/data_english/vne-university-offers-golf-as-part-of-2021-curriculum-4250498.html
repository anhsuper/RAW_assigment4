Any students interested in golf can sign up for the program starting in the 2021-2022 academic year, alongside 20 other sports like football, volleyball, etc.Nguyen Viet Hoa, director of the university's Center for Physical Education and Sports, said the school has partnered up with a golf academy to provide training for teachers and build necessary facilities."Accessing this high-end sport during their school year will teach students to improve themselves, build up their confidence and expand their relationships upon graduation," he said."Even though our PE teachers all have knowledge and experience in sports training, training them for a new discipline can take a lot of time."Students do not have to pay extra when signing up for this curriculum, with the school to provide all necessary training equipment.
