Mu Cang Chai, a rural town lined up with mesmerizing rice terraces in Vietnam’s northern highlands, has been named one of the 19 most picturesque peaks on earth.
U.S. travel site Insider called it “a hidden gem” where the “terraced rice fields are a shade of green so deep you’ll feel like you’ve stepped into a painting.”
Depending on the time of year, the color can vary from emerald green to golden yellow and light brown.
Mu Cang Chai in Yen Bai Province is around seven hours drive to the northwest of Hanoi. It sits at 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) above sea level at the foot of the Hoang Lien Son mountain range.
People from the H’Mong ethnic group started carving rice terraces into the mountain range centuries ago and are still harvesting them today.
