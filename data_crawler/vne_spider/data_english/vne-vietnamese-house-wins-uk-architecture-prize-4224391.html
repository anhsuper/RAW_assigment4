Nghia is renowned for using traditional and local materials in his designs, and Bat Trang House is no exception.The building got its name due to its location near Hanoi’s Bat Trang village, famous for its centuries-old traditional pottery, and for its facade made of perforated red clay ceramic tiles."This ceramic cloak protects the house from the sun in the summer and from the wind in the winter, while the holes ensure that the house still gets plenty of natural light," Wallpaper* wrote."Large gaps allow for the trees and plants from the elevated gardens to burst through the terracotta-colored facade."The structure doubles up as a shophouse. The ground floors are a showroom for ceramic products while the top four levels have a kitchen, living room, five bedrooms and several airy gardens.Other entries that made the shortlist in the category were Mole House in the U.K., House of the Big Arch in South Africa, Barghouti House in Jordan, and PW house in Canada.The jury included British installation artist and filmmaker Isaac Julien, winner of 2020 Designer of the Year Award Sabine Marcelis, CFDA Award-winning fashion designer Christopher John Rogers, Silicon Valley maven and Google vice president of design for hardware Ivy Ross, and architect Kjetil Trædal Thorsen.Nghia and his team have won a number of international awards, including three at the LOOP Design Awards last December.
