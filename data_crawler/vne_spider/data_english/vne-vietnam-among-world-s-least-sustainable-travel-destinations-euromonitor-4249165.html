Motorbikes and cars are banned from the town center for large parts of the day â€“ from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 3 p.m. to 9:30 p.m.Cu Lao Cham, or Cham Islands, a UNESCO-recognized world biosphere reserve near Hoi An in Quang Nam Province, abandoned plastic bags and started a campaign to clean up the environment back in 2009.Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc in 2019 said that Vietnam should strive for zero disposable plastic use in urban stores, markets and supermarkets by 2021 and for no plastic products to be used across the entire country by 2025.The country has been ranked the fourth biggest polluter of oceans in the world by U.S.-based non-profit environmental organization Ocean Conservancy.
