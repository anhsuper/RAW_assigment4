Hau delivered his apology to a wheelchair bound Dimas following the medal awards Tuesday night, the players finding solace in embrace.
Dimas told Indonesian news agency Antara Hau had already apologized and that he bore no grudge.
Vietnam beat Indonesia 3-0 in the SEA Games men's football final in the Philippines Tuesday, one goal scored by midfielder Do Hung Dung and two by Hau.
At the 21' mark, Hau and Dimas collided and a subsequent ankle injury caused the Indonesian midfielder to miss the rest of the crucial contest.
