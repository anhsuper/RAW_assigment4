The capital has not recorded any new community transmissions since August 19, Ngo Van Quy, the city's deputy chairman, said at a Tuesday meeting with the Hanoi Steering Committee for Covid-19 Prevention. As such, city authorities have decided to loosen Covid-19 prevention measures, he added.Quy has also allowed the People’s Committee of Hoan Kiem District to reopen Hanoi’s iconic walking streets and relevant surrounding areas starting Friday. After Vietnam’s second coronavirus wave hit in late July, Hanoi had closed down its walking streets on August 21 to contain the virus.Covid-19 preventative measures like mask wearing or hand sanitization must be continued however as there could still be potential infection risks, especially considering possible international flight resumption in the near future, Quy added.Saigon has already reopened its 180 bars and dance clubs starting September 7, following over a month of closure to curb the second Covid-19 wave.During the second strike, Hanoi recorded 39 Covid-19 cases and no death.Vietnam has confirmed 1,063 Covid-19 cases so far, 99 still active. A total 35 people have succumbed to the disease, many being elderly patients suffering underlying conditions like diabetes and kidney failure.The country has not recorded local transmissions in nearly two weeks.
