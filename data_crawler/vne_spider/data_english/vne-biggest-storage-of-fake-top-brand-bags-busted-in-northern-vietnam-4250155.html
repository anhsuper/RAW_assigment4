The value of the products, found in Nam Dinh Province’s Vu Ban District Wednesday, has been estimated at around VND6 billion ($262,000) by Nam Dinh authorities.Police and other functional forces had to use 10 3.5-ton trucks to transport the seized goods, consisting mostly of handbags. They said this was the biggest storage of such goods found in northern Vietnam after a six-month investigation.The sellers, unable to prove the origins of these products, mostly distributed the goods via social media, using dozens of Facebook accounts to evade authorities.They listed an address in Hanoi’s Bac Tu Liem District as the official store, but authorities found nothing there.A spokesperson of French luxury clothing and accessories brand Hermès said that it conducts no sales on social media or e-commerce websites in Vietnam.It only has two official stores for handbags in the country, one in Hanoi's Hoan Kiem District and the other in Ho Chi Minh City's District 1.
