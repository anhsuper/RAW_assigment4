Vietnam ranked highest in the optimism index compiled by Singapore's United Overseas Bank with a score of 62.4 out of 100, well ahead of Malaysia (53.8), Singapore (52.7), Thailand (52.0), and Indonesia (49.6).More than 3,500 respondents in five countries were asked about concerns related to Covid-19 infection, continued restrictions on gatherings and travel, the economic impacts of the pandemic, and their personal and financial well-being and outlook.Around 81 percent of Vietnamese respondents said they expect life to go back to normal by the end of this year, the highest rate in any country.Asked about a possible economic recovery this year, 72 percent of Vietnamese believed they would be financially better off, again the highest rate."Their optimism could be due to Vietnamâ€™s success in handling the Covid-19 crisis, which has set a strong foundation for the recovery of the economy," Harry Loh, CEO of UOB Vietnam, said.Vietnam was one of the few economies in the world to grow in 2020 by 2.9 percent. UOB Global Economics and Markets Research forecast 7.1 percent growth in 2021.
