Vietnam National Seed Group (NSC), food producer Bibica Corporation (BBC) and the Southern Seed Corporation (SSC) said they hope they could be listed and traded on the Hanoi Stock Exchange at the earliest.Securities brokerage VNDirect has said it would also move but has not filed an application.The exchange switch is one of several measures mooted to deal with the overload on the Ho Chi Minh Stock Exchange’s 20-year-old system, which began in December as record numbers of new investors entered the market.The Ministry of Finance recently commissioned IT giant FPT to provide solutions to the overload. The process could take three or four months.There were 2.88 million stock trading accounts at the end of February, 21 percent up from a year earlier and equivalent to 2.96 percent of the country’s population.
