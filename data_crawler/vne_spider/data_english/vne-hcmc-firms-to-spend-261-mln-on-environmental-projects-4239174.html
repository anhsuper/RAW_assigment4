The HCMC Urban Environment Company (Citenco) and the HCMC Finance and Investment State-owned Company (HFIC) said the projects would use advanced technologies to promote sustainable development and foster a green economy.One of the projects is to complete a 20 ha landfill at the Phuoc Hiep waste treatment complex in Cu Chi District. The landfill, which can process 2,000 tons of waste each day, is expected to commence within the first quarter this year and be completed in three months. The VND200 billion landfill project will be a backup plan when existing landfills become overloaded or stop operating.The construction of a VND3 trillion waste-to-energy power plant within the same landfill is another project. With an incinerating capacity of 1,000 tons of waste a day, the plant is expected to help reduce trash in the city while producing electricity for the national grid.Another project, relocating a hazardous waste treatment plant from Hoc Mon District to Cu Chi, would also be carried out by 2023. The VND400-600 billion project will help increase the plant’s waste treatment capacity to 1,000 tons a day.The second phase for the construction of the Da Phuoc Cemetery in Binh Chanh District is also a part of the plan. The 46 ha, VND2 trillion cemetery will have over 46,000 graves. It will met reburial demands from the Binh Hung Hoa and other cemeteries in the city.The firms plan to spend VND100-200 billion on replacing garbage trucks and other environmental vehicles by buying 50-100 new vehicles.Nguyen Ngoc Hoa, HFIC Board of Members, said over 50 percent of the project’s investment capital would be derived from existing sources, and the rest mobilized from both domestic and foreign sources.HCMC now discharges around 9,300 tons of domestic waste a day, with 10 percent more being added every year. By 2025, the city aims to have 90 percent of construction waste and all industrial and medical waste collected and treated. It also targets that by 2023, 60 percent of households in the city sort out waste at home before it is collected for recycling.
