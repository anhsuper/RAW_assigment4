The Asian Football Confederation (AFC) released the list of the best goalkeepers in the Asian World Cup qualifiers this week.
Lam has had a solid defensive record in the competition. He has kept two clean sheets in three matches, one in Vietnam's 0-0 draw in Thailand and one in the 1-0 victory against Malaysia in Hanoi's My Dinh Stadium. He only conceded one away goal in Vietnam's 1-3 win over Indonesia in Bali on Tuesday.
Lam featured in the list alongside some famous keepers like Jo Hyeon-woo of South Korea, Alireza Beiranvand of Iran and Matthew Ryan, who is playing for the English Premier League club Brighton and Hove Albion, of Australia.
Goalkeepers from Japan, Qatar, China, Thailand, North Korea and Tajikistan are others on the list. There are 40 teams competing in Asian World Cup qualification.
Lam is currently playing for Thai club Muangthong United and has been their number one keeper since joining in March 2019.
Vietnam are now second in Group G with seven points after three outings. Thailand, who defeated the UAE 2-1 on Tuesday, top the group with the same amount of points, but have a better goal difference.
Vietnam will play their next two qualifiers at home against the UAE and Thailand next month.
