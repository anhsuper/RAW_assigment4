A Singaporean court sentenced Chew Teng Wee, 29, to 14 years in jail and 24 strokes of the cane. Wee pleaded guilty to one charge of aggravated rape and one charge of robbery. Two other charges - of aggravated sexual assault and aggravated rape, were taken into consideration by the court,Â Channel News Asia reported.
The 28-year-old Vietnamese woman, whose identity is protected by a court order, first met Chew at a club in May 2017. She was a sex worker.
Chew wanted sex with her at his home in return for S$200 ($147) one night in August 2017, but said he had no money with him at the time and offered to pay her later.
When the woman refused, Chew placed a knife against her neck and threatened her, leaving a cut on the woman.
He then proceeded to rob and rape her, while filming and taking photos of the woman performing sex acts on him, telling her not to inform anyone about the incident or he would publish the footage on Facebook.
The woman told her friends about what had happened afterwards. A passer-by contacted the police after seeing how distressed she was.
