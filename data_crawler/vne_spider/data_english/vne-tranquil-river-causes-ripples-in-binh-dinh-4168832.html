To reach the 3-km river, travel about 50 km to the northwest of Quy Nhon Town in the south-central province. At the intersection of Highway 19 with Nguyen Thien Thuat Street in Phu Phong Town, Tay Son District, turn left onto a curved concrete road.According to locals, the name Ham Ho (pointed teeth) may well derive from the jagged rocks jutting from the river or sound of water pouring into the many rock pools. Tourists often reach Ham Ho via a small stream roofed by emerald trees. Each boat can carry up to seven adults.Ham Ho River, the confluence of the Cat and Dong Huu rivers, empties into Phu Phong River in Binh Dinh. Despite passing through steep mountain terrain, the river is calm and tranquil thanks to the formation of a basin.The scenery here is quiet, desolate and quite suited to those wanting to escape the urban hustle. The area was once the base of the Can Vuong Movement, a large-scale Vietnamese insurgency between 1885 and 1889 against French colonial rule.Along the riverbank, shacks serve as guard posts and rest stops.Except for flood season at the year end, the river is an ideal destination most other times.Specialties here include grilled rohu, seahorses and siamese fish with rice paper rolls and fresh vegetables.In some parts along the river, rocks have piled up right under or above the water surface, creating many rapids. Having entered the river by boat, visitors can make their exit via this zigzag path along its banks.
