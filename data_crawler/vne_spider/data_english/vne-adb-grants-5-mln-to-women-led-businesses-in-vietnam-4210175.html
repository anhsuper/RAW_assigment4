The lender, formally Asian Development Bank, aims to incentivize banks to restructure existing loans or extend new ones to at least 500 women-led SMEs in Vietnam.The grant, signed by ADB and the government of Vietnam on Tuesday, will help these businesses avoid bankruptcy, preserve employment and access credit at a time when banks are reducing lending, the bank stated.Five banks, ACB, BIDV, SHB, TPBank and VPBank, have volunteered to compete for the grant by finding eligible businesses to fund on a first-come, first served basis.Andrew Jeffries, ADB country director for Vietnam, said support in accessing critical financing is essential for women-led small- and medium-sized enterprises adversely affected by Covid-19.Economic disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic have fallen hardest on small and medium businesses. In the first 11 months, nearly 93,500 companies suspended operations, up 16 percent year-on-year, according to General Statistics Office.The funding is part of Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative (We-Fi), which is governed by 14 founding contributing countries and managed by the World Bank. It aims to mobilize more than $1 billion to improve the business environment for women-owned or led small and medium enterprises.Last year, ADB received $20.19 million from the initiative to support businesses in Vietnam and the Pacific.
