The business school was recently awarded the prestigious EPAS accreditation from EFMD for its MBA program spanning the next five years. Its Master in Economics of Banking and Finance (MEBF) has received the same accreditation for a similar period.EFMD is considered one of the must-have accreditations for top business schools. By the end of 2020, there were only 124 EFMD accredited programs from 90 schools in the world.This is the 5th consecutive accreditation for the CFVG MBA since 2008 and the first time for the MEBF, positioning both among the top 124 EFMD accredited programs in the world."This achievement demonstrates the school's high educational quality. CFVG has maintained its pioneering position in Vietnam by receiving three accreditations: two from EFMD and one from CGE," a CFVG representative stated.During the assessment process in November 2020, EFMD required the school to meet many strict and rigorous criteria pertaining to its training activities as well as overall strategy, vision and mission.One of the outstanding advantages of CFVG in Vietnam is its drive to ensure faculty, publication, student, graduate internationalization.CFVG launched its MBA in 1992 while the MEBF program was brought to Vietnam 19 years ago by ESCP Business School and Paris Dauphine University. This Master in Finance program has been regularly named among the top 5 best financial degrees in Europe by the Financial Times.The school was established in 1992 by the Vietnamese and French governments with the mission of training young managers to become elite leaders based on a European knowledge system. EPAS accreditation in 2008 was a milestone that helped the school rapidly expand its international cooperation with leading business schools and universities.After 28 years, the list of CFVG's partners has grown to 32 schools, of which 44 percent are in France and 56 percent in other European, American and Asian countries. The school is preparing the registration process for AMBA and AACSB, aiming to grab triple crowns in the next five years.
