Ban Wei Bing, 39, and Ban Shan Ke, 45, were part of a four-member gang that illegally entered Vietnam for the purpose of breaking into factories and offices to steal.The two others are at large and the police are looking for them.The gang came to Vietnam in July 2019 and stayed in a hotel in Da Nang’s Son Tra District and hired motorbikes to travel around to commit their burglaries.On July 22 they broke into a company selling construction materials in Hoa Vang District on the city’s outskirts, used iron bars to break open a safe box and stole over VND997 million in cash.They then returned to China and came back to Da Nang a month later, this time to break into a textile company in neighboring Quang Nam Province and steal VND500 million.They also broke into three other companies in Da Nang, but took nothing.Investigators said after each burglary the men would disperse in different directions and return to China for a while before coming back to Da Nang for the next job.Bing and Ke were arrested in October 2019 as they were leaving the city.In August a HCMC court sentenced five Chinese burglars to 14-16 years in jail for stealing VND4.7 billion ($203,500) from several companies and toll stations.
