I hope my test returns negative," said Nguyen Thi Hong Nhung, who hails from the Central Highlands' Gia Lai Province.Tran Thi Kieu, 62, from Gia Lai has her swab sample taken by a medic."The moment I stepped off the bus and saw doctors and nurses in protective suits, I was a bit worried. I felt more relieved after I had my samples taken and tested," she said.By 6 a.m., 101 samples had been collected to be tested at Thu Duc Hospital.At Saigon Train Station in District 3, passengers arriving from outbreak areas are also tested, including crew members.The SE7 train from Hanoi on Thursday carried no passengers from outbreak areas, so only the crew were screened.Dang Xuan Dinh, head train driver, has his samples taken after arriving in HCMC from Hanoi."Frequent travel in multiple localities amid outbreaks has many train staff worried. But we are tested the moment we step into the station, so we're more relieved," he said.After around 20 minutes, 14 samples are collected.Body temperature checks occur at the station entrance.A representative of the Saigon station said the number of trains entering HCMC had dropped in recent days, especially those from outbreak areas like Hai Duong, Hanoi or Hai Phong. Each train only carries a small number of passengers, so most Covid-19 tests are done on crew members.Since Wednesday, the HCDC has randomly tested over 3,400 people entering the city via Tan Son Nhat airport, stations and reporting themselves at medical centers. So far, HCMC has basically managed to contain the chain of 35 transmissions related to its Tan Son Nhat International Airport.In Hanoi, the medical center of Hai Ba Trung District has taken samples from people returning from cities and provinces experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks for testing Friday morning.Since 8 a.m., people have lined up at the center for testing.
