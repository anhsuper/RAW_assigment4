Before the Covid-19 pandemic, ticket sales would hit VND5-6 billion a day during the peak season, according to Pham Dinh Huynh, deputy head of the Ha Long Bay Management Department.The sales only met 11 percent of monthly targets and the department is struggling to pay its employees, he told local media.Authorities only resumed ticket sales on March 2 after nearly a month of suspension due to the novel coronavirus outbreak in northern Quang Ninh Province, where the bay is located.The province has confirmed 61 cases since January 28, but has not recorded any new case since February 23.Last year, ticket sales fell by over 80 percent to VND230 billion due to flight restrictions and social distancing measures. The department aims to increase that figure by 2.6 times to VND600 billion this year.Quang Ninh Province is investing in various promotions to attract tourists to Ha Long Bay and other tourist destinations.
